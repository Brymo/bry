![Rice and Furikake](https://www.dropbox.com/s/soypwgdbjrvxmfl/20190429_124833.jpg?dl=1)

It is a dark, dark day when the pantry is out of instant ramen.  For some reason the japanese seem to have a knack for making convenient food taste good (I mean have you seen their 7/11s holy moly).  In any case, we were out of noodles so here's rice topped with furikake (brown + black granules) and bonito flakes (beige wispy ribbons) from Tsukiji fish market.

Furikake apparently came about in early 20th century Japan when it was made from ground fish bones, roasted seasame, poppy seeds and seaweed in order to address calcium deficits within the population at the time.  It was originally called *Gohan no tomo* which means *A friend for rice* and I think that's pretty dang cute.  This stuff would later get big in 1948 when Nissin Foods began manufacturing it to combat widespread malnourishment.  It was also made available to soldiers in WWI which considering how cheap and delicious it is comes with no surprise.

Today it's a pretty popular product eaten by tons of people including, obviously, myself.  Lunch was good.
