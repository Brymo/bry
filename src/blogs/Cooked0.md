This aesthetic bowl of poke salad goodness makes me so flippin happy.

Dee Why recently received some pretty major upgrades.  Alongside new trees everywhere and fresh tiles to cover up the filthy concrete we used to have, we also were gifted some major food chains.  As a UNSW grad I was already familiar with the food from Guzman x Gomez (bless their souls) and the finely crafted burgers from Grill'd have been known for awhile as well.  Fishbowl however, was new.

Rocking a minimalist interior and Tokyo nightlife menu design, Fishbowl knows their food and you can tell they care about it deeply.  Everything from the yearly availability of their tuna to Sam (their local kale farmer) is freely presented to customers so you know what you're eating is good for you. All this thought shows in the food too!

This bowl of "Mr X." cost me $10 and was the best thing I've eaten all week.
